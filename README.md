#Description

#Instructions
For the stack I chose to implement a double ended queue using a circular buffer. The deque procudures to push at the tail of the queue makes it easier to implement the rotate operations requiered in the subject. Note that the program would also accept a double linked list implementation for the deque. You would only need to change the the definition and procedures of the deque.
